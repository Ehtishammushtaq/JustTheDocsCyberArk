# Master Policy

Changes are made by making an exception to the policy. Master policy is of global scope. Compare that to policy by platform where scope is granular based on the system under that platform. I can also set the behavior of a specific account by going to the “Edit account properties” and set the exception. Whenever I set an exception, it will ask me to choose a platform that will absorb this change.
