# PVWA


The **PVWA** is a web interface (GUI) that provides secure access to the Vault. Users can log in to manage passwords, access privileged accounts, and perform administrative tasks through a browser, making it easier and more secure to access privileged information. Users can login to this to access passwords. Moreover, if PSM is enabled, the CyberArk will directly handle the authentication part and will initiate the session to the target system from PVWA.
