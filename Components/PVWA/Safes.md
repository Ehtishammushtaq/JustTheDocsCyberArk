# Safes

In CyberArk, accounts are stored in secure containers known as "Safes". A Safe is a secure logical storage unit within the CyberArk Vault where privileged account credentials and other sensitive information are stored. Each Safe is isolated and has its own set of access controls and permissions, which can be configured to determine who can access the information within the Safe and what actions they can perform.

In addition to storing account credentials, Safes can also hold files and other secrets. Each Safe is protected by CyberArk's Digital Vault technology, ensuring that the contents are encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized users through the PVWA, PrivateArk client, or other CyberArk components.
